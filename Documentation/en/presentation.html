<P>Elody is a music composition environment based on a visual
functional language, a direct-handling user interface and Internet
facilities. It is written in Java and uses the real-time MIDI
services of <A HREF="http://midishare.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="new-window">MidiShare</A>.</P>

<P>Elody allows algorithmic descriptions and transformations of
musical structures and compositional processes. Its design tries
to promote a creative and experimental attitude (including for
the programming activity), as well as Internet users collaboration.</P>

<P>Working with Elody consists in <B>building musical objects</B>
by combining simple primitive objects (notes or rest), or programs.
The user interface is based on drag&amp;drop
and visual functionalities. Each user action results in an immediate
sound and graphical feedback.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Audio devices</H3>

<P>Elody generate MIDI messages that are then played on external <A HREF="midi.html"> MIDI devices</A> or on the internal <A HREF="sampler.html">sampler.</A>
</P>

<H3>Musical constructors</H3>

<P>All functionnalities are available by way of <B>visual constructors</B>.
A <B>constructor</B> is a particular way to create new expressions
by combining existing ones in sequence or in parallel for example.
Visual constructors are represented by one or several arguments
boxes. When the user drop expressions in these boxes, they are combined
and this produce an accessible and reusable result.
The constructors perform no real computation. The resulting expression
is a tree whose root is labeled with the constructor name and branches
which are the used sub-expressions. Therefore an expression always keep
track of all its components and the way to combine them: <B>the
intentional description</B>.</P>

<P>Here is the description of the different musical constructors
currently available:</P>

<H3>Editors</H3>

<P>Editors allow to work on Elody's objects by editing and modifying
them.</P>

<P>Here is the description of the different musical editors currently
available:</P>

<H3>Renderers</H3>

<P>The evaluation of an expression, that is the transition from
the <B>intentional description</B> to the corresponding <B>extensional
description</B>, is only done for graphical and sound rendering.
Users always handle non-evaluated, intentional descriptions.</P>

<P>Here is the description of the different renderers currently
available:</P>

<UL>

  <LI><A HREF="guido.html">The Guido Viewer</A>
</UL>

<P>Elody objects displayed in a piano-roll like representation
can immediately be played using the <B>Ctrl+Click</B> command.
This allows to play objects even if they are not in a player.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Programming</H3>

<P>One of the main purpose of a music composition environment
is to allow to express intentional descriptions with all the required
generality, and to maintain the relation with the corresponding
extensional description. Reaching generality and abstraction within
intentional description presuppose a kind of programming. The
<B>homogeneous language approach</B> adopted in Elody tries to
insert the programming activity in a conceptual framework directly
related to the existing skills and knowledge of the user. Instead
of providing the user with a separate programming language with
specific concepts, syntax, semantic and editings tools, the key
idea of the homogeneous language approach is to extend in a consistent
way the domain of objects the user manipulates with his editing
tools to include user-defined programs. This is achieved mainly
by introducing the concepts of <A HREF="abstraction.html"><B>abstraction</B>
and <B>application</B></A> of the lambda-calculus.</P>

<P>Elody is based on this approach. User-defined programs are
abstractions: generalized musical expressions obtained by <B>making
variable</B> parts of the existing expression. These abstractions
can be applied to other objects to produce a new result, or composed
to build new programs. Therefore Elody makes not real distinction
between musical objects and programs. Programs are just musical
objects with variables parts. They are visualized, manipulated
and assembled in a consistent way like any other musical objects.</P>

<HR>

<H3>Real-time Interactions</H3>

<P>A simple model of description of interactions with an input
stream has been introduced in Elody. Interactions are currently
limited to transformation processes composed and applied on the
real-time input stream. The <B><A HREF="real_time.html">real-time
stream</A></B> is an infinite sequence that contains all events
received in real-time by the system. Although this sequence is
only known when the expression is evaluated and reduced, it is
possible to manipulate it like a <B>known object</B>. The
system is in charge of translating actions described by the user
into effective operations that will <B>operate in real-time</B>,
during expression rendering. The user makes a specification in
terms of temporal organization and manipulation of the real-time
stream, the rendering engine will execute low level side effect
operations according to the specification.</P>

<HR>

<H3>File management</H3>

<P>Several tools are available to manage Elody documents. Elody
expressions can be saved in several different formats. The <B>HTML</B>
format save Elody expressions in their <B>intentional description</B>
thus keeping all the history of their construction. <B>MIDIFile</B> format
allows to save the <B>extensional description</B> to be used in
conventionnal notation softwares or sequencers. <B>GUIDO</B> format is
used for <B>conventional musical score notation</B>.</P>

<H3>Windows</H3>

<P>Here are some useful shortcuts for managing the windows organization:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>F9:</B> close all windows without leaving the application
	<LI><B>F10:</B> show all windows (useful if some are reduced or hidden behind those from another application)
	<LI><B>F11:</B> reorganize all windows in order to optimize the desk space
	<LI><B>F12:</B> reorganize all windows while trying to preserve their initial location (windows are magnetized)
</UL>

<P><B>DISCLAIMER</B> - Elody is a research product currently in
development. The musical language specification is not frozen
yet and may change in future versions.

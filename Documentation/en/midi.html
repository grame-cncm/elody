<P><B> msDrivers</B> application  allows to configurate MIDI devices to be used by the software. 
Elody used up to 32 MIDI channels, that will actually use the MIDI port 0 and 1. In the central column,
the port 0 to be used is selected.  Then the available MIDI input devices (left column), or output devices
 (right column) can be connected.
Same way for port 1.
<P> The internal sampler appears as output devices named <B> Sound Sampler Slot 0</B> and <B> Sound Sampler Slot 1</B>.
 By default, it is already connected to port 0 and 1.
